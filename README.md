### Research Work - Binary White Dwarfs + Binary Neutron Stars

Work with the Center for Computational Astrophysics at the Flatiron Insititute with Lieke van Son. 

Most of the "important" figures/main findings can be found in the making figures subfolder. 

The directories:

- COMPAS_analysys: Figuring out what COMPAS h5 files look like and doing general data analysis from them (also finding weird outcomes)
- CosmicIntegrationEdits: Editing some of the original original CosimicIntegration code found - https://github.com/TeamCOMPAS/COMPAS/tree/dev/compas_python_utils/cosmic_integration
- CosmicIntegrationOutputs: The plotting output of some of the FastCosmicIntegration runs.
- making_figures: The notebooks ran to make many of the plots that encompass main findings.
- neutron_star_analysis: Analayzing different properties of the binary neutron stars from the COMPAS output.
- useful_py_scripts: A collection of scripts with functions used in making figures and analyzing properties.
- white_dwarf_analysis: Analyzing different properties of the bianry white dwarfs.

I change my abbreviations for phenomena a lot but for clarity:
- WD+WD = Binary white dwarf
- BWD = Binary white dwarf
- NSNS = binary neutron star
- BNS = binary neutron star
